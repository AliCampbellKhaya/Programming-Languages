# Programming Languages

In this course I completed 3 components for a toy programming language:
* [I wrote a PEG parser for a context free grammar](#Parser)
* [I implemnted an evaluator for declarations and expressions](#Evaluator)
* [I designed a strict typing system](#Typing)

## Parser
All code for the parsing project is in the rust file [Parser](Parser/src/parser.rs)

## Evaluator
All code for the evaluating project is in the rust file [Evaluator](Evaluator/src/evaluator.rs)

## Typing
All code for the typing project [Typing](Typing/src/evaluator.rs)
